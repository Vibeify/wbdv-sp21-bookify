#TODO: 

- Current home page is login->auth, doesn't fit requirements but should be fine. If we really want we can just route    the user to the main music player page first and have them login after? Otherwise is generally fleshed out.
- Profile page needs to be implemented & linked to backend. Needs to be routed to from the music player.
- Search
- Login/Register needs to be implemented & linked to backend. Needs to be routed to from the music player.


CS5610 Final Project P1

State the problem to solve
Although Spotify has a wide variety of playlists and songs, it can be difficult to find music curated based on specific themes, such as different moods, themes, and keys.
Include a description of at least two types of users that would use your Web application
For each of the types of users, provide two goals the user would like to achieve with your Web application
General end user: looking for users 
Goal 1: find music curated based on mood
Goal 2: save curated music to their own Spotify account
Moderator:
Goal 1: Keep user generated tags appropriate
Goal 2: Prevent users from sharing offensive playlist content
State the overall strategy of how you intend to solve the problem
We’re allowing users to import their own spotify playlists and add tags to them that other users can search for. This will allow users to find music that more closely fits their needs. Users will also be able to like and comment on playlists inside Vibeify. Playlists that have a high number of likes
One of the main requirements is to work with data available from some public, free, Web API. Provide a brief description of the Web API you intend to use
We intend to use the Spotify playlist API to load playlists from users’ spotify accounts, and to allow users to save playlists to their own spotify accounts.
